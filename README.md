A frontend developer who pays attention to detail, values good UI/UX, and writes clean, reusable, and efficient code â€” with a strong grasp of HTML semantics.

I'm driven by critical thinking, deep learning, and an idealist mindset. Unique in every way, and getting more unique every day.
My name is Joseph Pascal Ugochukwu, and Iâ€™d love to connect and have meaningful conversations with brilliant minds â€” tech-related or not.

Got some spare time? Letâ€™s connect. ðŸ‘‰ pascaljoseph729@gmail.com wattapp: +2347046253045
